### Who
My name's Ryan and I currently for as a Network Engineer in Australia.</p>

### What
I have decided to take the #100DaysOfCode challenge and decided to use GitHub to store the code I create over the next 100 days. Along with the code, you can find my log that 'll be using to keep track of my time, challenges and outcomes.

### Where
I'll be doing the majority of the challenge from home.

### When
I will be starting the challenge today the 21st of March 2021.

### Why
The networking field is changing and a shift is occurring towards the programming and automation of networks. Instead of being left behind, I want to challenge myself to increase my skills and knowledge in this area, along with making myself accountable.

I will mainly be using the Python programming language, along with other tools to increase my skills in using Python to read and manipulate network devices. This will include Python modules such as Jinja2 and Netmiko, and automation tools such as Ansible.
